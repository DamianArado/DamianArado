I believe that's where this all started and I never looked back! 

The aim is use to use my skillset to solve real world problems for the org that trusts me, bringing a positive difference to the product, and to gain valuable experiences while working with or without team on challenging projects. Rough seas make stronger sailors. - Robin Sharma
